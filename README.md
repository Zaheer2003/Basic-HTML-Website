## Simple HTML Website Project

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple website using only HTML with multiple pages. The website includes a homepage, projects page, articles page, and a contact page. Each page has a navigation bar that links to all other pages. This structure is created to be easily styled later using CSS.

## Project Structure

The website consists of the following pages:

- **Homepage**: The landing page of the website.
- **Projects**: A page to showcase various projects.
- **Articles**: A page to feature different articles.
- **Contact**: A page with a contact form for users to reach out.

Each page is linked through a navigation bar that is consistent across all pages.

## Files Included

- `index.html` – Homepage of the website.
- `projects.html` – The page for showcasing projects.
- `articles.html` – The page displaying articles.
- `contact.html` – The contact page with a contact form.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**: Present on all pages with links to other pages (Home, Projects, Articles, Contact).
- **SEO Meta Tags**: Each page includes SEO tags like meta description, keywords, and author information to improve search engine ranking.
- **Semantic HTML Structure**: The website uses semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) for better structure and readability.
